# transfer
This is the stroage of a code that uses the github platform 
to transfer files across devices.
Why you ask? Well that is because i am too lazy to use ftp or any of the other well established
protocols so instead i made a weird mish-mash of .sh scripts and shady websites to transfer some files
using a platform in which everyone can see what those files are.
And yes, for any of those that may be wondering, the script does output h everytime it is complete.
